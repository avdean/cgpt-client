## OpenAI Text Models Frontend Client
This project hosts a frontend client that leverages OpenAI's text models. The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly interface that makes it easier to interact with OpenAI's text models, rather than use their current offering. The frontend client allows users to input text and generate new text based on OpenAI's models.

### Features
Easy to use interface
Leveraging OpenAI's state-of-the-art text models
Ability to generate new text based on user input
Getting Started

To use the OpenAI Text Models Frontend Client, simply visit the hosted site at https://davinci-server.glitch.me/ and insert your Glitch server URL.

### Server
The server leverages Glitch.com to provide a backend for the frontend client. Users can copy the server using Remix and add their API in the env variable. This allows users to customize the backend and add their own API credentials to use with OpenAI's text models.

To get started with the server, simply visit the hosted server on https://cgpt2-5.glitch.me, remix the project and insert your own env and insert the projects' URL in the frontend.

### Future Plans
Currently, the frontend client is a simple interface that allows users to generate new text based on OpenAI's models. However, there are plans to make the frontend more configurable and allow users to customize the input and output settings. Stay tuned for updates!
